    <h4>This is our soda machine project. It asks you which soda you want, and dispenses it. If you type something that isn't on the list, it will ask you the question again.</h4>

      This is our butterfly catcher project. The net and butterflies are two seperate turtles. The net moves where the mouse clicks to make it look like you're catching the butterfly. Every time you click the butterfy a new one appears and your score goes up. There are 3 different levels and each level has a wider range of where the butterflies go.</h4>

      This is our Christmas Card project. When you run the program it asks for your name, and then it draws a letter. When you open the letter it draws the snowman, starts snowing, and writes "Merry Christmas" and the name you entered.

      In this project we had code that would check the status of a fish tank. There were many bugs in the code and we had to use the debugger to solve the unexpected errors.

      In this game you use the arrow keys to control Big Justice and you try to collect as many cookies as you can. There are three levels to play.

      Our conclusion was that the rover data came from the Inland Forests, since the graphs matched the conditions of temperature, light, winds, and sounds.

      We had to analyze the honey data in each state using code. With the code we were able to create graphs showing the mid, low, and high level of honey production in each of the states represented on the graphs.
